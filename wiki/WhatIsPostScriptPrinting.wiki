Nearly every modern printer on the market accepts PostScript.  PDF writers such as PrimoPDF and CUPS PDF Writer accept PostScript.  Microsoft's XPS Document Writer accepts PostScript as well.

Although PostScript is a very universal standard, there are limitations to PostScript for industry printing:
  # PostScript does not support cutting receipts
  # PostScript cannot magnetically encode a card 
  # PostScript cannot eject a cash drawer (although "eject after print" is an option in some specialized PostScript driver)
  # PostScript can have setbacks when printing hundreds of labels (such as alignment on thermal tape).

Most industry printing uses raw printing instead.  WhatIsRawPrinting
